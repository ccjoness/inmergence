<p style="position:absolute;top:116px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft10"><b>“Eleven” by Sandra Cisneros.&#160;</b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:155px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft12">&#160;<br/>What they don't understand about birthdays and what they never tell you is that when&#160;<br/>you're eleven, you're also ten, and nine, and eight, and seven, and six, and five, and four,&#160;<br/>and three, and two, and one. And when&#160;you wake up on your eleventh birthday you&#160;<br/>expect to feel eleven, but you don't. You&#160;open your eyes and everything's just like&#160;<br/>yesterday, only it's today. And you don't feel eleven at all. You feel like you're still ten.&#160;<br/>And you are—underneath the year that makes you eleven.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Like some days you might say something stupid, and that's the part of&#160;you that's still ten.&#160;<br/>Or maybe some days you might need to sit on your&#160;mama's lap because you're scared,&#160;<br/>and that's&#160;the part of you that's&#160;five. And maybe one day when you're all grown up maybe&#160;<br/>you will need to cry like if you're three, and&#160;that's okay. That's what I tell Mama when&#160;<br/>she's sad and needs to cry. Maybe she's feeling three.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Because the way you grow old is kind of like&#160;an onion or like the rings inside a tree trunk&#160;<br/>or like my&#160;little wooden dolls that fit one inside&#160;the other, each&#160;year inside the next one.&#160;<br/>That's&#160;how being eleven years old is.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>You don't feel eleven. Not right away. It takes a few days, weeks even, sometimes even&#160;<br/>months before you say Eleven when they&#160;ask you. And you don't feel smart eleven, not&#160;<br/>until you're almost twelve. That's the way it is.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Only today I wish I didn't have only eleven years rattling inside me&#160;like pennies in a tin&#160;<br/>Band-Aid box. Today I wish I was one hundred and two instead of eleven because if I&#160;<br/>was one hundred and two I'd have known what to say when Mrs. Price put the red&#160;<br/>sweater on my desk. I would've known how to&#160;tell her it wasn't&#160;mine instead of just&#160;<br/>sitting there with that&#160;look&#160;on my&#160;face and nothing coming out of my&#160;mouth.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Whose is this?&#34;&#160;Mrs. Price says, and she holds the red sweater up in the air for all the&#160;<br/>class to see. &#34;Whose? It's been sitting&#160;in the coatroom&#160;for a month.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Not mine,&#34; says everybody, &#34;Not me.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;It has to belong to somebody,&#34; Mrs. Price keeps saying, but nobody can remember. It's&#160;<br/>an ugly sweater with red plastic buttons and&#160;a collar and sleeves all&#160;stretched out like you&#160;<br/>could use it for a jump&#160;rope. It's maybe a thousand years old and even if it belonged to&#160;<br/>me I wouldn't&#160;say so.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Maybe because I'm&#160;skinny, maybe because she doesn't like me, that stupid Sylvia&#160;<br/>Saldivar says, &#34;I think it belongs to Rachel.&#34; An ugly sweater like that all raggedy and&#160;<br/>old, but Mrs. Price believes her. Mrs Price takes the sweater and puts it right on my desk,&#160;<br/>but when I open my&#160;mouth nothing comes out.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;That's not, I don't, you're&#160;not . . . Not mine.&#34;&#160;I finally say in a little voice that was maybe&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:109px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft22">me&#160;when I was four.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Of course it's yours,&#34; Mrs. Price says. &#34;I&#160;remember you wearing it once.&#34; Because she's&#160;<br/>older and the teacher, she's right and I'm&#160;not.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Not mine, not mine, not mine, but Mrs. Price&#160;is already turning to&#160;page thirty-two, and&#160;<br/>math problem number four. I don't know why but all of a sudden I'm&#160;feeling sick inside,&#160;<br/>like the part of me that's three wants to come out of my&#160;eyes, only I squeeze them&#160;shut&#160;<br/>tight and bite down on my teeth&#160;real hard and try to remember today I am eleven, eleven.&#160;<br/>Mama is making a cake for me for tonight, and when Papa comes home&#160;everybody will&#160;<br/>sing Happy birthday, happy birthday to you.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>But when the sick feeling goes away and I open my eyes, the red sweater's&#160;still sitting&#160;<br/>there like a big red mountain. I move the red sweater to the corner of my desk with my&#160;<br/>ruler. I move my&#160;pencil and books and eraser as&#160;far from&#160;it as possible. I even move my&#160;<br/>chair a little to the right.&#160;Not mine, not mine, not mine.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>In my head I'm thinking how long till lunchtime, how long till I can take the red sweater&#160;<br/>and throw it over the schoolyard fence, or&#160;leave it hanging on a parking meter, or bunch it&#160;<br/>up into a little ball and toss it in the alley. Except when math period ends Mrs. Price says&#160;<br/>loud and in front of everybody, &#34;Now, Rachel, that's enough,&#34; because she sees I've&#160;<br/>shoved the red sweater to the tippy-tip corner&#160;of my desk and it's hanging all over the&#160;<br/>edge like a waterfall, but I don't care.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Rachel,&#34; Mrs. Price says. She says it like&#160;she's getting mad. &#34;You&#160;put that sweater on&#160;<br/>right now and no more nonsense.&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;But it's not—&#34;&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>&#34;Now!&#34; Mrs. Price says.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>This is when&#160;I wish I wasn't&#160;eleven because&#160;all the&#160;years inside&#160;of&#160;me—ten, nine, eight,&#160;<br/>seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one—are pushing at the back of&#160;my&#160;eyes when I put&#160;<br/>one arm&#160;through one sleeve of the sweater that&#160;smells like cottage&#160;cheese, and then the&#160;<br/>other arm&#160;through the other and stand there with&#160;my arms&#160;apart like&#160;if the sweater hurts&#160;<br/>me&#160;and it does, all itchy and full of&#160;germs that aren't&#160;even mine.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>That's when everything I've been holding in&#160;since this morning, since when Mrs. Price&#160;<br/>put the sweater on my desk, finally lets go,&#160;and all of a sudden I'm&#160;crying in front of&#160;<br/>everybody. I wish I was invisible but I'm&#160;not. I'm eleven and it's&#160;my birthday today and&#160;<br/>I'm&#160;crying like I'm&#160;three in front of everybody. I put my head down on the desk and bury&#160;<br/>my face in my stupid clown-sweater arms.&#160;My face all hot and spit coming out of my&#160;<br/>mouth because I can't&#160;stop the&#160;little animal noises from&#160;coming out of&#160;me until there&#160;<br/>aren't&#160;any more tears left in my eyes, and it's just my body shaking like when you have&#160;<br/>the hiccups, and my whole head hurts&#160;like when you drink milk too fast.&#160;<br/>&#160;</p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:109px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft33">But the worst part&#160;is right before the bell rings for lunch. That stupid Phyllis Lopez, who&#160;<br/>is even dumber than Sylvia Saldivar,&#160;says she remembers the red sweater is hers! I take it&#160;<br/>off right away and give it to her, only Mrs. Price pretends like everything's&#160;okay.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>Today I'm&#160;eleven. There's a cake Mama's making for tonight and when Papa comes home&#160;<br/>from&#160;work we'll eat it. There'll be candles and presents and everybody will sing Happy&#160;<br/>birthday, happy birthday to&#160;you, Rachel, only it's too late.&#160;<br/>&#160;<br/>I'm&#160;eleven today. I'm&#160;eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one,&#160;<br/>but I wish I was one hundred and two. I wish&#160;I was anything but eleven, because I want&#160;<br/>today to be far away already, far away like a&#160;runaway balloon, like a tiny o in the sky, so&#160;<br/>tiny tiny you have to close your eyes to see it.&#160;<br/>&#160;</p>
