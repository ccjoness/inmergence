<p style="position:absolute;top:116px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft10"><b>“Eleven” by Sandra Cisneros. </b></p>
<p style="position:absolute;top:155px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft12"> <br/>What they don't understand about birthdays and what they never tell you is that when <br/>you're eleven, you're also ten, and nine, and eight, and seven, and six, and five, and four, <br/>and three, and two, and one. And when you wake up on your eleventh birthday you <br/>expect to feel eleven, but you don't. You open your eyes and everything's just like <br/>yesterday, only it's today. And you don't feel eleven at all. You feel like you're still ten. <br/>And you are—underneath the year that makes you eleven. <br/> <br/>Like some days you might say something stupid, and that's the part of you that's still ten. <br/>Or maybe some days you might need to sit on your mama's lap because you're scared, <br/>and that's the part of you that's five. And maybe one day when you're all grown up maybe <br/>you will need to cry like if you're three, and that's okay. That's what I tell Mama when <br/>she's sad and needs to cry. Maybe she's feeling three. <br/> <br/>Because the way you grow old is kind of like an onion or like the rings inside a tree trunk <br/>or like my little wooden dolls that fit one inside the other, each year inside the next one. <br/>That's how being eleven years old is. <br/> <br/>You don't feel eleven. Not right away. It takes a few days, weeks even, sometimes even <br/>months before you say Eleven when they ask you. And you don't feel smart eleven, not <br/>until you're almost twelve. That's the way it is. <br/> <br/>Only today I wish I didn't have only eleven years rattling inside me like pennies in a tin <br/>Band-Aid box. Today I wish I was one hundred and two instead of eleven because if I <br/>was one hundred and two I'd have known what to say when Mrs. Price put the red <br/>sweater on my desk. I would've known how to tell her it wasn't mine instead of just <br/>sitting there with that look on my face and nothing coming out of my mouth. <br/> <br/>"Whose is this?" Mrs. Price says, and she holds the red sweater up in the air for all the <br/>class to see. "Whose? It's been sitting in the coatroom for a month." <br/> <br/>"Not mine," says everybody, "Not me." <br/> <br/>"It has to belong to somebody," Mrs. Price keeps saying, but nobody can remember. It's <br/>an ugly sweater with red plastic buttons and a collar and sleeves all stretched out like you <br/>could use it for a jump rope. It's maybe a thousand years old and even if it belonged to <br/>me I wouldn't say so. <br/> <br/>Maybe because I'm skinny, maybe because she doesn't like me, that stupid Sylvia <br/>Saldivar says, "I think it belongs to Rachel." An ugly sweater like that all raggedy and <br/>old, but Mrs. Price believes her. Mrs Price takes the sweater and puts it right on my desk, <br/>but when I open my mouth nothing comes out. <br/> <br/>"That's not, I don't, you're not . . . Not mine." I finally say in a little voice that was maybe </p>

<p style="position:absolute;top:109px;left:135px;white-space:nowrap" class="ft22">me when I was four. <br/> <br/>"Of course it's yours," Mrs. Price says. "I remember you wearing it once." Because she's <br/>older and the teacher, she's right and I'm not. <br/> <br/>Not mine, not mine, not mine, but Mrs. Price is already turning to page thirty-two, and <br/>math problem number four. I don't know why but all of a sudden I'm feeling sick inside, <br/>like the part of me that's three wants to come out of my eyes, only I squeeze them shut <br/>tight and bite down on my teeth real hard and try to remember today I am eleven, eleven. <br/>Mama is making a cake for me for tonight, and when Papa comes home everybody will <br/>sing Happy birthday, happy birthday to you. <br/> <br/>But when the sick feeling goes away and I open my eyes, the red sweater's still sitting <br/>there like a big red mountain. I move the red sweater to the corner of my desk with my <br/>ruler. I move my pencil and books and eraser as far from it as possible. I even move my <br/>chair a little to the right. Not mine, not mine, not mine. <br/> <br/>In my head I'm thinking how long till lunchtime, how long till I can take the red sweater <br/>and throw it over the schoolyard fence, or leave it hanging on a parking meter, or bunch it <br/>up into a little ball and toss it in the alley. Except when math period ends Mrs. Price says <br/>loud and in front of everybody, "Now, Rachel, that's enough," because she sees I've <br/>shoved the red sweater to the tippy-tip corner of my desk and it's hanging all over the <br/>edge like a waterfall, but I don't care. <br/> <br/>"Rachel," Mrs. Price says. She says it like she's getting mad. "You put that sweater on <br/>right now and no more nonsense." <br/> <br/>"But it's not—" <br/> <br/>"Now!" Mrs. Price says. <br/> <br/>This is when I wish I wasn't eleven because all the years inside of me—ten, nine, eight, <br/>seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one—are pushing at the back of my eyes when I put <br/>one arm through one sleeve of the sweater that smells like cottage cheese, and then the <br/>other arm through the other and stand there with my arms apart like if the sweater hurts <br/>me and it does, all itchy and full of germs that aren't even mine. <br/> <br/>That's when everything I've been holding in since this morning, since when Mrs. Price <br/>put the sweater on my desk, finally lets go, and all of a sudden I'm crying in front of <br/>everybody. I wish I was invisible but I'm not. I'm eleven and it's my birthday today and <br/>I'm crying like I'm three in front of everybody. I put my head down on the desk and bury <br/>my face in my stupid clown-sweater arms. My face all hot and spit coming out of my <br/>mouth because I can't stop the little animal noises from coming out of me until there <br/>aren't any more tears left in my eyes, and it's just my body shaking like when you have <br/>the hiccups, and my whole head hurts like when you drink milk too fast. <br/> </p>

That stupid Phyllis Lopez, who <br/>is even dumber than Sylvia Saldivar, says she remembers the red sweater is hers! I take it <br/>off right away and give it to her, only Mrs. Price pretends like everything's okay. <br/> <br/>Today I'm eleven. There's a cake Mama's making for tonight and when Papa comes home <br/>from work we'll eat it. There'll be candles and presents and everybody will sing Happy <br/>birthday, happy birthday to you, Rachel, only it's too late. <br/> <br/>I'm eleven today. I'm eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and one, <br/>but I wish I was one hundred and two. I wish I was anything but eleven, because I want <br/>today to be far away already, far away like a runaway balloon, like a tiny o in the sky, so <br/>tiny tiny you have to close your eyes to see it. <br/> </p>
